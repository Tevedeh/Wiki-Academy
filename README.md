# Welcome to WikiTeacher!
## About

**WikiTeacher** is a tool to help you quickly learn interesting subjects. While most people can quickly learn by simply pulling up a Wikipedia page about a specific thing and reading a few paragraphs, WikiTeacher attempts to give you a deeper understanding of the subject by compiling different Wikipedia entries that it deems relevant to your selected subject. 

## How does it work?

WikiTeacher compiles a list of Wikipedia entries by executing a [breadth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) with your subject of choice as root node. After a set amount of iterations, a graph will be compiled with nodes referring to Wikipedia entries that were encountered during the traversal. Many different algorithms can be used on this graph to produce interesting 'learning paths', i.e. using Dijkstra to find a 'shortest-path- from one topic to another related topic, or simply analyzing connectivity of the graph to guess which entries are worth your reading time (which is WikiTeacher's original purpose).
